# TODO.md — open items and resume point

Read at session start (after `TECH_DEBT.md` and the tail of `SESSION_LOG.md`). Tick/remove as done.
Last updated: 2026-10-14 evening (session close: ST-004 resolved; ST-016 awaiting homelab checks; ST-010 pieces 1-3 done).

## Resume here (new conversation)
1. **ST-016 rename — close it.** Homelab reports Kopia check 4 (15 Oct 01:00 snapshot contains `rkneo50q/stratrad`)
   and restore check 5 (`data/corporate_actions/history.csv`, SHA-256), then removes the old mirror. Then Rakesh deletes
   `~/env_backup_st016_20261014` and `/etc/samba/smb.conf.pre_st016_20261014` on prod (Claude gives the block), git pull
   on prod, sign-off. Record in CONFIG.md "Backup".
2. **ST-010 baseline backtest** — branch `st/ST-010-baseline` (open, last commit `ac666fb`). Pieces 1-3 done (adjusted
   prices, indicators + benchmark, engine + runner, both strategies). Next:
   a. headline fix: worst 12-month loss also as % of the value 12 months earlier; count unmatched actions inside the run
      period only;
   b. piece 5 validator on real outputs (limits every day, lots complete, charges recompute, no lookahead, repeatable);
   c. piece 4 report card (plain-language summary, consistency, bootstrap range, risk vs Nifty 500, costs/tax per year);
   d. prod runs (fetch_benchmark first), then walk Rakesh through the three cards (baseline; rakesh_top4 faithful and
      within limits). Preliminary numbers in `tech-debt/ST-010.md`.
   Open design question for Rakesh: under the limits, profits above the Rs 1 L at-cost cap sit idle — should the cap
   grow with realised gains?
3. Then ST-012 (database; before execution) → ST-006/007/008/009/011; ST-005 (sectors); ST-017/018 later.
4. Prod SSH paste glitch: `echo 'set enable-bracketed-paste off' >> ~/.inputrc` (new session), or update PuTTY.

Done 2026-10-14: ST-004 universe (merge `1fe1a08`, prod confirmed); ST-016 rename steps 0-8; data model approved.
Done 2026-10-11: ST-001/002/003/013/014/015.

## Rakesh — outside this repo
- [x] MyInvestIQ prod includes `98255d6` (prod HEAD `47c82fb`, pulled 2026-10-10)
- [ ] **MyInvestIQ TD-251 (High, raised 2026-10-11):** daily corporate-actions fetch + backfill from 2025-08-26.
      Their table today: 100 rows, ex_date 2025-08-29..2026-08-25, last fetched 2026-08-28, so **2025-08-26..28 is in
      neither source** until TD-251's backfill. Our history findings are recorded there as design inputs.
      ST-012 depends on it (merge + freshness check).
- [x] MyInvestIQ TD-247 lint: fixed 2026-10-09; lint on main 0 errors, `--no-verify` no longer needed
- [ ] Optional: `sudo apt install tmux` on rkneo50q; tablet SSH = Tailscale app + Termius/JuiceSSH to
      `100.103.189.15:22` as rakeshbk
- [ ] Optional: `git config --global core.editor notepad`

## Notes to carry into later STs
- Live system (ST-008 guardrails / news): ST-003 found 6 genuine one-day crashes 2015-2020 (UNITECH, DHFL, INFIBEAM,
  JETAIRWAYS, YESBANK, IDEA; `config/ca_exceptions.csv`), all news-driven (rumours, regulator action, insolvency).
  Rakesh 2026-10-11: the final system must handle these -- e.g. gap-down / circuit handling for GTT stops, and
  news checks before buys.
- ST-004: EASTSILK (and any symbol with a capital reduction during a suspension) has an incomparable price series
  across the gap; universe filters keep penny stocks out anyway. ST-013 found the same for post-insolvency relistings
  (INDOSOLAR->WAAREEINDO, SPENTEX->CLCIND, NTL->NEUEON): start a new series at a run gap > 30 days with an ISIN change.
  Identities come from `core/securities.py` (key = today's symbol).
- ST-005 (Trendlyne): the `[stratrad]` Samba share is read-only (Samba default), so the weekly drop needs a
  writable path — e.g. a folder on the rkfspool share (Y:) that the importer reads.
- ST-006 (Kite): keys in `.env` → exclude `.env` from the backup mirror (see backup handover).
- ST-012: read-only Postgres role on `portfolio_watch` for `corporate_actions` and `fii_daily_flow`.
- Weekend special sessions (e.g. Sunday Muhurat) may be missing from the legacy archive — accepted, negligible.
- Plan doc (Claude doc): "AI Strategy Trading System — Research & Implementation Plan".
