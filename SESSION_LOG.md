# SESSION_LOG.md — one entry per session, newest at the bottom

## 2026-10-08 — project start
- Plan written (Claude doc "AI Strategy Trading System — Research & Implementation Plan"); decisions: ₹10k/week,
  ₹1L cap at cost, loss tiers 10/15/20%, positional 1–6 months, Nifty 500, Mumbai VM gateway, new repo,
  model changes need Rakesh's approval, objective = minimise loss / maximise profit over rolling 12 months.
- ST-001 scaffold: `ca79aa3` (main). ST-002: `9eb9bb0`, `8916d84`, `b038a42`, `a17e2aa`, `657a093` (main).
- Prod: legacy bhavcopy 2014–Jul 2024 downloaded; UDiFF gap fetched and relocated; validation PASS.
- MyInvestIQ touched (Rakesh committed): `.gitignore` lines for strategy-trader data (`d4e13fc`, `8810a50`) —
  removed again under ST-014.
- Data moved to `/home/rakeshbk/strategy-trader/data/`; Samba `[strategy-trader]` → X:.
- ST-014 on branch `st/ST-014-workflow-docs`.
- Status at close: ST-001, ST-002 Moved to Prod — pending verification; ST-003 Design proposed; ST-014 In progress.

## 2026-10-08 (evening) → 2026-10-11 — ST-014 merged, homelab, ML learning; conversation closed
- ST-014 merged to main `2869ebb` (branch commit `80325ce`, 27 files verified with `git --no-pager show`). Pulled on prod.
  Fail-check passed: `find ~/myinvestiq -path '*strategy*' -o -name bhavcopy_legacy` printed nothing.
- MyInvestIQ `.gitignore` strategy-trader lines removed: `98255d6` (Rakesh, `--no-verify` because of the unrelated
  TD-247 lint ERROR). Prod `~/myinvestiq` pull still to be confirmed.
- Prod data now in `/home/rakeshbk/strategy-trader/data/{bhavcopy_legacy,bhavcopy_udiff}`, logs in `.../logs/`.
  Samba `[strategy-trader]` (read-only) → Windows X:. `.env` holds BHAVCOPY_ARCHIVE_DIR + LEGACY/UDIFF overrides.
- Homelab map: `C:\RKOneDrive\OneDrive\Work\homelab\patch_2026_10_08.py` added the strategy-trader service, the
  share and X:, marked "NOT YET IN THE BACKUP CHAIN"; lint 0 errors; `homelab_infra.html` rebuilt.
- Backup: how MyInvestIQ is backed up (n8n 23:30 pg_dump + FFS Job 2 → `/mnt/rkfspool/daily/rkneo50q/myinvestiq`,
  Kopia 01:00 snapshots `/mnt/rkfspool/daily`). strategy-trader mirror to be set up from the homelab project
  (handover text in TODO.md). Checked 2026-10-09: `Y:\rkneo50q` holds only myinvestiq.
- Access: Claude can read X:/Y:/Z: through the laptop (Windows-MCP PowerShell) while it is on; cannot run commands on prod.
- Learning (no code): how the ML works, generic ML pipeline mapped to the project, historical data quality,
  features/noise/standard models. Captured in `docs/ML_PRIMER.md`.
- Process notes: merges given with `-m` (no editor); `git --no-pager` for show/log; CRLF noise → `.gitattributes` (ST-015).
- Status at close: ST-001, ST-002, ST-014 Moved to Prod — pending verification (await Rakesh "prod confirmed");
  ST-003 Design proposed; ST-015 Not started. Open items: `TODO.md`.
- Conversation moved: this chat is kept for learning; work resumes in a new conversation from `TODO.md`.

## 2026-10-11 — ST-001/002/014/015 closed; ST-003 and ST-013 built and closed; ST-004 designed
- Sign-offs (prod confirmed 2026-10-11): ST-001, ST-002 (2025-02-01 Budget Saturday fetched; full-range check
  `missing 0`), ST-014, ST-015 (merge `1a66fc2`: .gitattributes LF, git conventions, rule 11 = every command block
  says laptop/prod + full path).
- ST-003 corporate actions 2014..2025-08-25 (merge `bf2f689`): multi-part subject parser, 805 actions, 55 mapped to
  the symbol in use on the ex-date (feed uses today's symbol), DVL voided, 6 news-confirmed crashes, 5 capital
  reductions decided, automatic suspension-gap rule; validator PASS on prod (763/763, spot 5/5).
- ST-013 rename stitching (merge `c8a2c77`): `core/securities.py` (company key = today's symbol), rename validator;
  8 renames missing from NSE's list now in `config/symbol_changes_extra.csv`; 282 confirmed, PASS on prod.
- Backup: homelab added FFS Job 3 + Kopia + freshness check; `.env` excluded. Recorded in `docs/CONFIG.md`.
  Open (homelab, 2026-10-12): Kopia snapshot with all data folders + `history.csv` restore.
- MyInvestIQ: TD-251 raised (daily CA fetch + backfill from 2025-08-26); TD-247 lint fixed; prod has `98255d6`.
- Slips: a commit landed on main (branch already existed) — moved with `git branch -f` + `reset --keep`;
  `config/*.csv` silently ignored by `*.csv` — fixed in `.gitignore`. Both in `vault/LEARNINGS.md` / CONFIG.md.
- Decided: universe aligned to Nifty 500 semi-annual review; research data in files (Parquet), operational data in
  Postgres; DB (ST-012) after ST-010, before execution. `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` proposed (`fa316fb`), awaiting approval.
- Status at close: ST-004 Design proposed on `st/ST-004-universe` (uncommitted `requirements.txt`). Resume: `TODO.md`.

## 2026-10-14 — ST-004 closed; ST-016 rename done (checks pending); data model approved; ST-010 engine built
- Day start: ST-004 index status fixed (was "Not started"). Data model reviewed with Rakesh and approved (stratrad DB,
  sectors, guardrails twice, exit path, charges per order via Kite's virtual contract note, position adjustments).
- ST-016 rename strategy-trader -> stratrad, one step at a time: GitHub repo, prod folder + venv + .env + Samba share,
  laptop X: (Claude desktop app restarted to re-resolve the drive), homelab Job 3/health/map; prod proof PASS. Open:
  Kopia + restore checks 15 Oct, temp backup deletion, sign-off.
- ST-004: panel 5,399,886 rows / 165 MB (9 relisting series breaks); universe 25 Nifty 500-aligned reviews; validator
  PASS (coverage 3,156 days, no lookahead 25/25, survivorship, fidelity 82.6% / top-100 99). Resolved, merge `1fe1a08`.
- Decisions: lots per weekly buy with own GTT stops; multiple strategies per stock; Rakesh's holdings = strategy
  `manual` in the same Zerodha account; per-stock cap 8% of capital cap (soft); new listings conservative; fidelity
  alarm 80% / 95; time exit after >12 months (LTCG); ST-017 dashboards and ST-018 trades-to-sheet logged.
- ST-010: design approved (costs and tax verified from zerodha.com/charges and incometaxindia.gov.in); pieces 1-3 built
  (adjusted prices 762/763, benchmark NSE+Yahoo with 13 special sessions filled, engine, 86 tests). Rakesh's own rule
  (top 4 by 1-year gain, gain-weighted, average-based exits) added. Preliminary trial 2014-10..2023-12: Nifty 500 12.8%/yr;
  baseline 2.0%; rakesh_top4 faithful 19.4% (max DD -56%); within limits 8.4%. Not yet validated.
- Slips: a commit landed on main again (branch switch refused); moved with merge + `reset --keep`.

## 2026-10-15 — ST-016, ST-010, ST-019 closed; strategy review written; ST-012 scoped
- ST-016 closed (merge `150f9da`): Kopia `k13eb1c5` + `history.csv` restore verified (SHA-256 re-checked via X:), old
  mirror removed, temp backups deleted.
- ST-010: Test 1 redefined with Rakesh -- level (a) per lot, level (b) per strategy at cost, rolling 12 months; the
  denominator "all lots bought" was rejected (reused money counted repeatedly) -> worst 12-month rupee loss / Rs 1 L stake.
  Validator (checks 1-9; tax beyond cash = tax owed) and report card (9 sections) built; prod runs = laptop to the byte;
  resolved (merge `d6ea9f7`). Rakesh: capital grows only when he allocates more (no cap-growth re-test).
- ST-019 (from validator check 9: MIRZAINT -86% = RedTape demerger): demergers adjusted like splits, factor = prev close /
  ex-day **close** (the open is often not the discovered price), falls > 5% only; 94 applied; rakesh_top4 within limits
  8.4% -> 9.1%/yr; list approved, resolved (merge `5d9e73d`).
- Strategy review doc (Claude Docs) written: baseline reject, rakesh_top4 within limits = candidate, faithful fails Test 1.
  Open for Rakesh: verdict; Test 1 and paper profits given back.
- Slips: killing "python" processes on the laptop killed the connector itself (twice); never stop python processes
  wholesale. OneDrive locks new folders right after commit ("Deletion of directory failed" on branch switch; harmless).

## 2026-10-16 — ST-012 database live (backup check pending); ST-006 Kite login live (expiry check pending)
- ST-012: split -- corporate-action merge moved to ST-020 (blocked by MyInvestIQ TD-251). Migration 001 = all 14 tables;
  `migrate` (checksums), `check_database` (47 permission checks attempted for real). Dev DB added in MyInvestIQ's dev
  container (Rakesh's question); dev first, then prod: PASS both. Restore test PASS. Homelab: nightly verify-then-rename
  dump, `Dumps OK?` If node (n8n SSH node never fails on its own -- portfolio_watch fixed too), health check 5 (26 h),
  `.env` vetoed on the X: share.
- ST-006: free Personal plan; manual daily login; callback via Cloudflare tunnel + Access (`kite.myinvestiq.ai`); JWT
  verified (homelab recommendation); thin `requests` client, no order endpoints. First live login 15:47 (76 holdings).
- ST-007 notes: static IP only for order endpoints; Airtel static IP ruled out; idea = static-IP exit VM (proxy only).
- Slips: prod DB passwords pasted into chat (rotated with a piped block, nothing printed); `.env` lines held the
  `<pw>` placeholder; first Kite login used the old app's key (new app `stratrad` created).
- Status at close: main `d6ce146`. Resume: `TODO.md` item 0 -- ST-012 scheduled-backup report and ST-006 expiry check
  on Sat 17 Oct, then ST-007.
